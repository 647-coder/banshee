Getting Started
---------------

Just clone the repo and install the necessary node modules:

```shell
$ npm install                   # Install Node modules listed in ./package.json (may take a while the first time)
$ npm start                     # Compile and launch
```

Usage
-----

* `npm start` - Spins up Koa server to serve your app at `localhost:3000`. HMR will be enabled in development.
* `npm run compile` - Compiles the application to disk (`~/dist` by default).
* `npm run dev:nw` - Same as `npm start`, but opens the redux devtools in a new window.
* `npm run dev:no-debug` - Same as `npm start` but disables redux devtools.
* `npm run test` - Runs unit tests with Karma and generates a coverage report.
* `npm run test:dev` - Runs Karma and watches for changes to re-run tests; does not generate coverage reports.
* `npm run deploy`- Runs linter, tests, and then, on success, compiles your application to disk.
* `npm run lint`- Lint all `.js` files.
* `npm run lint:fix` - Lint and fix all `.js` files. [Read more on this](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface.html#fix).

**NOTE:** Deploying to a specific environment? Make sure to specify your target `NODE_ENV` so webpack will use the correct configuration. For example: `NODE_ENV=production npm run compile` will compile your application with `~/build/webpack/_production.js`.
